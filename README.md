# scipy-tentative-numpy-tutorials

This is my attempt to try out and walk through the entire [Tentative NumPy Tutorial](http://wiki.scipy.org/Tentative_NumPy_Tutorial#head-d3f8e5fe9b903f3c3b2a5c0dfceb60d71602cf93), kindly created and shared by [SciPy.org](http://scipy.org).

# Some personal goals

I wish that by end of the exercise I will become a more confident user in the following tools:

- Git and GitHub
- The Python NumPy Package (i.e. the `numpy` module)
- IPython Notebook (and the remaining Anaconda packages / tools)
- GitBash
